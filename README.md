# Get Started

Go into your terminal and choose a directory that you want the project to reside in.
Enter into your terminal
`git clone https://github.com/markspereira/react-native-web3-boilerplate.git RNWeb3BoilerPlate`

`cd RNWeb3BoilerPlate`

`npm install`

`react-native run-ios`

### If you haven't installed node.js

#### Install NVM

Check to see if you have nvm by running ``` nvm --version ``` in your terminal

If not then download it from
https://github.com/creationix/nvm

#### Install Node.js

Check to see if you have node by running ```node --version``` in your terminal

If you don't then

``` nvm install 8.60.0 ```

Go into the root directory of the app
```cd RNWeb3BoilerPlate```

Then enter
```npm install```

Then 
```react-native run-ios```

You can then look into `App.js` to see the code I've written.
